# Code of Conduct

I strive to maintain an open and safe environment for contribution. There are a
lot of people out there with a lot of opinions and philosophies.  Therefore, as
a rule, any discussion, pull request, feature request, bug report, or other
contribution, made in part or as a whole with the apparent purpose of talking
about, criticizing, or affecting anything but what the code should be and how
it should behave is at best off topic, and at worst offensive to somebody. I
reserve the right to delete any comments or block PRs if those contributions
are hurting someone's feelings through blatant attack or insensitivity.

* Also:
  - Be nice.
  - When someone implements a feature or fixes a bug, please thank them.
  - When a bug or feature has not received attention in a long time, please be
    patient and forgiving.
  - When someone disagrees with you, that's okay.
  - Remember that we are all real people.
